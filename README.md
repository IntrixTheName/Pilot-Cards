#   Pilot Card Game
A digital recreation of a complex card game

### **Professional Note:**

  This is the first time I'm attempting a visual-based and event-driven program. This project was my idea, and I recieved assistance from friends and professors along with online resources to complete this project. Full list of outside assistance can be found in [insert filename when available]. As also encouraged by one of the professors I recieved assistance from, this is also the first of my projects important enough to consider licensing, so see LICENSE.txt.

### **Personal Note:**

  Pilot (what we called it at the time, I'm considering changing it) is a card game my ex created back in high school. It was my first relationship, and strong enough to outmatch any other relationship I've had since. We mainly bonded over this game because, like me, he had a creative mind that was hard to contain. I think I only ever beat him once out of the one-to-two hundred games I played with him. When the pandemic hit my senior year, he got stuck at home and accidentally outed to his father. I only heard from him twice after that and it's been two and a half years (at time of writing) since I last heard from him. This is one of the few memoreies I still have of the relationship that changed my life, and I'm hoping I can use this project to spread the happiness and wonder that it brings me. It gets lonely to play a two-player game as the only one left who knows how to play, after all :)
