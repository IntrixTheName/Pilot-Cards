Pilot- A strategy card game
---------------------------

Setup: Separate a deck of cards by color, then each player takes a color. Specific suits don't
        matter, only the color. Imagine a 4 x 4 grid on the playing table, that's where the cards
        will be placed. For a visual reference, it's standard to keep your shuffled deck face-down
        nedt to the second row (see diagram st the end). Draw your hand to 4 cards and procede to the
        instruction section.

Instructions: This game is somewhat of a cross between Chess and War, cards can be played
        on the board, trying to drain the opponent's health before the opponent drains yours.
       
        To start your turn, move any cards you currently control on the board according to their rules.
        Afterwards, you need to sacrifice a card. This sacrifice can be a card in your hand or
        the top card of your deck. Place this sacrifice face-up on top of your trash pile. For the
        remainder of your turn, you can play any card in your hand with a value less than or equal to
        the value of the sacrifice (Ace counts as low for this game).

        After sacrificing a card, you may lay down up to 3 other cards, even if the sacrifice came from
        the deck. Some cards have special abilities, see table at the end for reference, but the cards can
        generally only be layed down in the two rows closest to the player on an empty space.

        When you are done laying down your cards, the turn passes to your opponent.

Standard Card Rules: Any asterisks in this section indicate there is at least one card in the special
        section that breaks the mentioned rule. At the start of the player's turn, any cards they control
        move forward one row*. If a card moves to a space occupied by another card, the cards "battle". The
        card with the higher value wins the battle*.

Special Card Rules:
        A - Can be placed anywhere on the board, not just the first two rows
        2 - Moves 2 rows forward each turn
        3 - Kills any card, even if it's a higher value
        4 -
        5 - Stays stationary, kills any card with a higher value, killed by cards with a lower value
        6 -
        7 -
        8 -
        9 -
        10- Can be placed on top of any occupied space in the first two rows, even if the space has a higher value card
        J - When placed down, remove one opponent's card on the board of your choosing
        Q - Draw 2 from your deck, you can place as many cards as you have in your hand until the end of your turn
        K - Clears all opponent's cards from the board
